# VR

## Libraries:

Matlab Simulink 3D Animation Library. It is a subset of matlab's aeroblocks VR

## Issues:

Nodes are 'read-only' meaning that the nodes (data-points) can't be added programmatically. 


## Classes

`vrworld` holds the data about the objects you are representing.
`vrfigure` is used to show the `vrworld`
