# Steroscopic vs Stereopsis

Stereoscopic simply means to take an image and make it appear to have depth.
In contrast, stereopsis is the transformation to generate depth information and a 3D model from two images -- i.e. from the eye.

# Transforming Images with Stereopsis

Usually you want to take a pair of images and 'rectify' them into one. What I want to do is the opposite - Take an image and rectify it back.  
Uses mathematics called epipolar geometry.
